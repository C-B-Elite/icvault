# IC Vault
In order to support Dapps handling sensitive data we need seamless end-to-end encryption to ensure that the IC does not get to see any cleartext. As example IC Vault enables the management of key value pairs linked to a location or application. IC Vault focuses on the transparent access of managed data by all registered devices of a specific user. Thereby, it is assumed that the devices is added to the user’s Internet Identity. We leverage this fact and thereby demonstrate the power of Internet Identity. By “seamless” we mean that no additional communication between the devices is required, i.e. no scanning of QR codes by one device on another, etc. Each device only communicates directly with the IC.
