# IC Vault
In order to support Dapps handling sensitive data we need seamless end-to-end encryption to ensure that the IC does not get to see any cleartext.

For the scope of the hackathon we assume the devices belong to the same user. Furthermore, we assume that the devices are already added to the user’s Internet Identity. We want to leverage this fact and thereby demonstrate the power of Internet Identity. By “seamless” we mean that no additional communication between the devices is required, i.e. no scanning of QR codes by one device on another, etc. Each device only communicates directly with the IC. Devices can be remote from each other.
